# ✈️ US Airline Sentiment Dashboard

An interactive dashboard that explores how people feel about major U.S. airlines based on Twitter data.
This project transforms raw tweets into clear visual insights about customer satisfaction, complaints, and overall public sentiment.

## 📊 What’s Inside?

### The Big Picture
A clear breakdown of Positive, Negative, and Neutral sentiments.
### Airline Face-off
Compare how different airlines are performing based on customer feedback.
### Time Machine
Filter tweets by time of day to explore when customer activity peaks.
### The “Buzz”
A word cloud highlighting commonly used terms (yes, delays and cancellations appear a lot!).
### Map View
A simulated map showing where feedback is coming from across the United States.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

Airlines receive thousands of mentions on social media every day.  
I built this project to explore how Python and data visualization can turn that noise into meaningful insights — like understanding why customers are frustrated with a specific airline without reading every individual tweet.
